       <h2> CLUB INFO</h2>
    
       <p> Welcome to the 2022 Doherty programming club! Our club is dedicated to not only honing your coding abilities but also to developing 
    critical skills such as problem solving, creativity, and mental resilience. It is our strong belief that anyone, with the right dedication and fortitude, can become
    a great programmer. As the world becomes more technologically advanced and dependent on computers, coding is a skill that helps you understand these emergent 
    technologies, and it also gives you the power change them yourself. As with any skill, it will be hard, it will be frustating, and you will want to quit.
    Yet, it is imperative that you don't; that you keep trying even if the odds seem stacked against you, even if it seems like an unbreakable barrier. You are not alone, and
    you will not be alone. We are a community, and we will help you in your struggles, and we will cherish your successes. Help is everywhere, and the answers
    are there for those who want it. Happy coding!
