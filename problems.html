  <h2> Why do problems? </h2>
  <p> An athlete who never plays will never reach their full potential in their sport. An artist who never draws can never hope to create the Mona Lisa.
    Similarly, as a programmer you won't get too far if you don't practice your skills. Maybe you think that doing problems seems like a waste of time, that it'd be more productive of your time to 
  do something else entirely. Maybe you're right. However, for those hoping to really put into practice what they learned, there's no better way than by solving a problem.
Programming is a challenging field not because programming languages themselves are hard to master, but because using these languages
to solve a difficult task can tend to be very complicated. But that is why you practice, because you want to get better. Every week 
we will post a problem set that tests the topics we discussed on the club meeting of that week. This is a club, you're obviously not 
required to do these problems, but we highly encourage you to if you want to retain the information while also sharpening your 
problem solving skills. </p>

            <p> You know a family with three children. Their ages form an arithmetic sequence: the difference in ages between the middle child and youngest child is the same as the difference in ages between the oldest child and the middle child. For example, their ages could be 5, 10 and 15, since both adjacent pairs have a difference of 5 years.

            Given the ages of the youngest and middle children, what is the age of the oldest child?

<br><br>Input: Two positive Integers, the age of the youngest child and the age of the middle child.<br>Output: The age of the oldest child </p>

          <p>You've had quite enough of confusing conversations with Americans who assume you're using Fahrenheit when Celsius is clearly the way to go. Rather than argue with them, you've settled for writing a program to conveniently convert temperatures measured in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit instead.<br>

<br>You came across the following formula, which holds true given that F is a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit while C is that same temperature in degrees Celsius: C = 5/9 * (F - 32)<br>

<br>Given a value of C, which is an integer between -40 and 40 (inclusive), determine the corresponding value of F, a floating point number, so that you can express the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for the Americans' benefit.</p>

            A Spooky Season
          </a>
          <p>Late October can be a rather frightening time of year. Night begins to fall ever earlier, ancient Pagan rituals make demons stir, and at the end of the month, hordes of small creatures can even be seen roaming the streets! It's a spooky sight if there ever was one.

<br><br>But just how spooky is this demonic festival? Its spookiness level can, in fact, be measured and represented as a single integer S (2 <= S <= 20). However, a simple number doesn't truly do the spooky sensation justice. As such, it can also be described with the word spoo...ooky, with exactly S o's.

<br><br>Given the integer S, can you cast a spooky incantation on your computer to have it produce the corresponding spooky word?

           </a>
           <p>  Jessie, James, and Meowth, members of the honourable Team Rocket, have unfortunately fallen on hard times. With their funds necessarily allocated to constructing all manner of giant robots and other devices, they've been having difficulty affording any food lately. But that's nothing that an honest day's work can't fix!

<br><br>James has a can of leftover paint, containing P (1 <= P <= 100) litres of the stuff. When combined with his boundless collection of bottlecaps, this can result in some high-quality wares. When a bottlecap is artfully covered with B (1 <= B <= 100) litres of paint, it turns into a completely legitimate, Pokémon league-certified gym badge!

<br><br>James will produce as many badges as he can using the paint, using exactly B litres each. Pokémon trainers love their gym badges, so each such badge is sure to sell for D (1 <= D <= 100) Pokédollars.

<br><br>There might still be some extra paint left over, once there's not enough for another complete badge. However, there's no need for it to go to waste - James will sell any remaining paint at a rate of 1 Pokédollar per litre.

<br><br>How much money will James make for Team Rocket in total, from his sales of badges and leftover paint? Hopefully it'll be enough for at least a loaf of bread!

<br><br>The first line of input consists of a single integer, P. The second line consists of a single integer, B. The third line consists of a single integer, D. The output should be a single integer.

          <p>You might be aware that the events of the Star Wars saga took place a long time ago, in a galaxy that was rather far away. But just how far away was it? We can try to describe it by repeating the word far a certain number of times in the following sentence format:

<br><br>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

<br><br>In the above example, the word far is repeated twice. However, we'd instead like to repeat it exactly N (1 <= N <= 5) times without changing the rest of the sentence at all. There should be a comma right after each occurrence except for the last one.

<br><br>Given N, can you produce the correct sentence?
