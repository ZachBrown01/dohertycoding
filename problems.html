<div class="Problems-Info">
  <h2> Why do problems? </h2>
  <p> An athlete who never plays will never reach their full potential in their sport. An artist who never draws can never hope to create the Mona Lisa.
    Similarly, as a programmer you won't get too far if you don't practice your skills. Maybe you think that doing problems seems like a waste of time, that it'd be more productive of your time to 
  do something else entirely. Maybe you're right. However, for those hoping to really put into practice what they learned, there's no better way than by solving a problem.
Programming is a challenging field not because programming languages themselves are hard to master, but because using these languages
to solve a difficult task can tend to be very complicated. But that is why you practice, because you want to get better. Every week 
we will post a problem set that tests the topics we discussed on the club meeting of that week. This is a club, you're obviously not 
required to do these problems, but we highly encourage you to if you want to retain the information while also sharpening your 
problem solving skills. </p>
